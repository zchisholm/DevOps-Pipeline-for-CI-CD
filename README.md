Phase 3 of [**The Knowledge House**](https://www.linkedin.com/school/theknowledgehouse/) Cybersecurity Fellowship represents a critical junction in our continuous journey of innovation and collaborative effort. As we delve into this phase, our focus sharpens on the intersection of cybersecurity, software development, and team dynamics. This period is not just an opportunity but a pivotal moment that cements the principles of teamwork and collective creativity. It is here that our fellows come together to develop impactful technological solutions, demonstrating the transformative power of unity in the tech sector.

For this capstone project, the team  goal is to implement an AI Chatbot application on AWS in a secure and automated manner by leveraging a DevOps approach. Specifically, we aim to design and configure a secure automated CI/CD pipeline that integrates security measures throughout the entire application lifecycle. This will enable us to deliver a secure and reliable AI Chatbot application faster by automating the integration of security practices into the development of the chatbot.

The key objective is to successfully implement a chatbot development workflow that incorporates secure automated processes, which will be achieved through the implementation of a secure automated CI/CD pipeline.

## <h1 align="left">Project Management </h1>
  
In our project, we employ Jira as a central tool for managing the development lifecycle of our AI Chatbot application. By organizing our tasks into clearly defined sprints, we ensure that each phase of the project is tracked and managed efficiently. This structured approach allows us to maintain visibility over progress and address issues promptly, fostering an environment of continuous improvement and accountability. Each sprint is designed to align closely with our overarching project goals, ensuring that every team member is synchronized and focused on delivering specific, measurable outcomes.
